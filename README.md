# Event-scheduler

Project Goals

Program Event scheduler aims to be a robust and user-friendly tool that empowers individuals and teams to effectively manage their time. 
Key objectives are:

-Simplified Event Planning: streamline the process of scheduling and managing events.
Conflict Prevention: eliminate scheduling conflicts through automatic detection
Clear Schedule Visualization: provide a well-formatted and organized overview of upcoming events.

Features:

-Event Creation: easily add events with customizable titles, start times, and end times.
-Conflict Detection: the scheduler automatically detects overlaps and alerts you to potential conflicts. 
-Schedule Display: view your scheduled events in a clear, sorted format (by start time).
-User-Friendly Interface: interact with the scheduler using an intuitive command-line interface.

Technologies Used

Python, Java Script, C#: programming languages in which the project will be availble and made.

Functionalities

1. Event Creation and Editing:

Users can add new events with details like title, start time, end time, and description.
Existing events can be edited or deleted.

2. Conflict Detection:

The scheduler automatically checks for overlapping events to prevent scheduling conflicts.
It can suggest alternative time slots or alert the user to potential issues.

3. Schedule Visualization:

Users can view their schedule in different formats, such as daily, weekly, or monthly views.
The scheduler can display events visually on a calendar or in a list format.

4. Reminders:

The scheduler can send reminders before events, either through email, SMS, or in-app notifications.
Users can customize reminder settings to suit their preferences.

5. Search and Filtering:

Users can search for specific events based on keywords, dates, or categories.
They can filter events by time period, priority, or other criteria.


Should be considered -->
Code Clarity:  ensure the code is well-structured, well-commented, and easy to understand.
Error Handling: implement robust error handling mechanisms to prevent unexpected errors.
